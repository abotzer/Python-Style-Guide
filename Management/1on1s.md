# 1on1's Guide

## Introduction

1on1's are personal meetings between a manager and an employee. 1on1s can be periodical and various topics can be discussed. Throughout my years as a manager I experienced a lot with 1on1s and in this updating document I would like to share with you my insights.   

## Infrastructure

Before the first occurence of 1on1 (with each employee), set up the infrastructure:
1. Set up a shared one-on-one document with each reporting employee. Record meetings' date, time, location, notes and action items.
2. Location - Away from a conference room or desk - head outside for a walk or a coffee house. Choose your favor depending on the nature of the meeting to come. If you are about to discuss merely professional issues, maybe an office setup is more appropriate. It could also change between different employees.
3. Time - when interruptions are least possible.
4. Agenda template - before each meeting send an email asking if “Is there anything special you would like to discuss in our next one-on-one meeting?”. Most people in most of the times will not have anything special, but if the do be sure you know about it before the actual meeting so you can prepare.
5. Meeting Flow - my suggestion: Personal Topics → Professional Progress → Environment → Alignment (employee' reflection against yours) → Relationships in the team → Next Steps (action items for the next 1on1 meeting)
